# AQ_environmental_data
## A collection of environmental data from Hurricane Island's aquaculture lease site
**Repository Overview:** This repository is a platform for organizing, archiving, and analyzing environmental data collected on our 3.2 acre aquaculture lease site and also provides a forum for scientific collaboration, transparency, and methods standardization.

**Project Objectives:** This project aims to collect and share site-specfifc environmental data from our monitoring devices: Tilt-current meter (TCM), Water Probe, and HOBO loggers. These devices provide data on a variety of abiotic features of our site including: temperature, current speed/direction, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and pH. 

**Tilt-Current Meter Data (TCM_enviro):** 

TCM_raw - all raw data from TCM device

TCM_enviro - cleaned .csv for average/maximum/minimum daily current data and 30-minute-interval temperature data for corresponding data collection dates

TCM.Rmd - R markdown file of code used for TCM data cleaning and organization
TCM_vis.Rmd - R markdown file of code combining data sheets and simple visualization, to be used as more data is collected
